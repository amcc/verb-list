<h2>Richard Serra: Verb List, 1967</h2>
        <h3>actions to relate to oneself, material, place, and process</h3>
        <p>
          Serra has talked at length about the central place this language-based
          drawing occupies in the development of his early sculptural practice.
          This work on paper suggests a common ground underlying Serra's
          practices in all mediumsâ€”from early sculptures to later monumental
          works, which not only twist and curve but also enclose, surround, and
          encircle. It shows Serra's debt to action painting and his proximity
          to Conceptual and performance practices; the list was published in the
          journal Avalanche in 1971.
